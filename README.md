# Earthquake

This project aimed to illustrate the relationship between **tectonic plates** and **seismic activity**. Earthquake data in the past 7 days were requested from <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/">USGS</a> with data on tectonic plates being retrieved from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates. <code>Leaflet</code> is the tool to plot all data on map based on their longitude and latitude. Magnitudes of earthquakes (represented by each circle) were reflected by the radii and colors of the circles.

Application is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed <a href="https://koudash-usquick.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
